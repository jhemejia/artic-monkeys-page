              <p class="bio-subtitle">
                Indie Rock Band from Sheffield, England
              </p>
              <p>
                Arctic Monkeys are an English rock band formed in Sheffield in
                2002. The group consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, guitar,
                keyboards), Jamie Cook (guitar, keyboards), Nick O'Malley (bass
                guitar, backing vocals), and Matt Helders (drums, backing
                vocals).

            <h3>Early Years & Formation</h3>
            <p>
              Arctic Monkeys formed in 2002 when friends Alex Turner and Jamie
              Cook received guitars for Christmas. They recruited schoolmates
              Matt Helders and Andy Nicholson to form the band. The name "Arctic
              Monkeys" was suggested by Cook's mother, and it stuck.
            </p>
            <p>
              In their early days, the band played local gigs in Sheffield and
              began recording demos. They gained a following through the
              internet and word-of-mouth, particularly through social media
              platforms like MySpace.

            <h3>Breakthrough Success</h3>
            <p>
              In 2005, Arctic Monkeys released their debut single "I Bet You
              Look Good on the Dancefloor" which reached number one on the UK
              Singles Chart. Their debut album "Whatever People Say I Am, That's
              What I'm Not" was released in 2006 and became the fastest-selling
              debut album in British music history.
            </p>
            <p>
              The album was critically acclaimed and won the Mercury Prize in
              2006. It featured hits like "When the Sun Goes Down" and "Fake
              Tales of San Francisco."

            <h3>Musical Evolution</h3>
            <p>
              Over the years, Arctic Monkeys have evolved their sound from
              garage rock to more experimental and sophisticated styles. Their
              second album "Favourite Worst Nightmare" (2007) showed a more
              mature sound, while "Humbug" (2009) incorporated desert rock
              influences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their 2013 album "AM" marked a significant shift towards a more
              R&B-influenced sound and became their most commercially successful
              album to date. The album featured hits like "Do I Wanna Know?" and
              "R U Mine?"

            <h3>Recent Years</h3>
            <p>
              In 2018, Arctic Monkeys released "Tranquility Base Hotel &
              Casino," a concept album that marked a dramatic departure from
              their previous work. The album featured a lounge music aesthetic
              and science fiction themes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their latest album "The Car" (2022) continued this experimental
              direction with orchestral arrangements and sophisticated
              songwriting.
